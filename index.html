    <h1>Greenlam App Study</h1>

    <h2>Why Greenlam?</h2>

    <p>Greenlam is a healthy lifestyle app targeting young professionals looking to improve their habits. We can help with everything from sleeping patters, gym schedules, healthy eating and connecting with support groups. We gathered the following data from a year of user data to evaluate our business compared to other healthy lifestyle apps typically used by our shared audience.</p>

    <h2>How We Stack Up:</h2>

    <h2>Conclusions</h2>

    <p>Greenlam has a pretty high download frequency and rating compared to the other apps we looked at. This is great! It means that our app and the marketing we do is successful in terms of reaching and serving our young professional audience. What we need to work on is user retention. Compared to other lifestyle apps that are popular to our client base, we had the lowest percentage of users who keep the app past 30 days!</p>

    <p>Two of our main competitors are Cookley and Cardify. These two apps demonstrate two different result types we saw. Cookley is consistent. They end up in the median area of downloads, rating and retention. Cardify on the other hand has one of the lowest download stats, but their ratings and percentage of users with the app after 30 days are in the top 5. Cookley is not a glamorous app, but has a reputation for being quick, reliable and free. They have built up a steady fan base over the past year. Cardify on the other hand is an app users pay for. This decreases their total downloads, but the results are unmistakable. We at Greenlam are moving towards purchasable features that add functionalities past the base free version. We believe this will improve our retention stats in the next year.</p>
      
    <p>In general, our research did not show a strict correlation between number of downloads, average rating and 30 day keep for all apps. We attribute this to the dozens of factors contributing to why an individual downloads or keeps a lifestyle health app. We plan to study user demographics to compare to these results.</p>
